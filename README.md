# face_mask_detection
👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about leveraging machine learning to solve real-world problems, and one of my most exciting projects is centered around face mask detection. In an ever-evolving world, ensuring public safety and health has never been more critical.

🔍 Project Overview:
In this repository, you'll find my work on a Face Mask Detection system using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The project aims to contribute to the global effort in mitigating the spread of contagious diseases, with a primary focus on face mask compliance.

💡 Key Features:

Deep Learning: I've implemented a deep neural network for image classification to accurately detect whether individuals are wearing face masks or not.
Dataset: You can explore the dataset I used for training, which is carefully curated and labeled with mask and non-mask images.
Model Training: Dive into the training process and see how the model learns to distinguish between masked and unmasked faces.
Inference: I've provided code for real-time inference using webcams or static images, allowing for seamless integration into security systems or public spaces.
Performance Metrics: Check out the evaluation metrics, like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the model's performance.
🌐 Deployment:
I've also included resources for deploying the face mask detection model in different scenarios. Whether you want to integrate it with a mobile app, a web application, or a Raspberry Pi-based system, you'll find guidance and code to get you started.

🌟 Contributions and Collaboration:
I welcome contributions from fellow machine learning enthusiasts, developers, and researchers. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or reach out if you'd like to collaborate on enhancing this project further.

🚀 Let's Make a Difference:
This project represents my commitment to leveraging AI for the greater good. Together, we can enhance public safety, protect public health, and contribute to a safer and more resilient future. Join me in this mission!
